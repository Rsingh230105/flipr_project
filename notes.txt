This file was added by GitHub Copilot on 2025-12-09 as a small test note.

- Purpose: Example file to demonstrate creating, staging, and committing a file locally.
- Commit message used: "chore: add notes.txt"

If you want me to add a GitHub remote and push this commit for you, reply with the repository URL (e.g. `https://github.com/yourusername/flipr.git`) and whether you prefer HTTPS (you'll need a PAT) or SSH.

If you'd rather push yourself, run these commands in PowerShell from the repo root:

```
cd 'C:\Users\RAVI\OneDrive\Desktop\Flipr'
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/flipr.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

Thanks — tell me how you'd like to proceed.
